# Game of Life

I'm learning Rust at the moment, and one of the Katas I'm going to do is [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). As I hadn't done it before, I wanted to get the general concept and prototype fast so used my usual language, Javascript.

And no tests! :-o
